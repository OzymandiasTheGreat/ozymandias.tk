Applications I have written, some more popular than others. Maintenance and bugfixing
are very time consuming, so unless I can generate some income from these, development will remain slow.

I also have a not-very-good habit of trying out new things and producing new
software even though I have a hard time maintaining the ones already written.

So if you find a bug, don't hesitate to send a pull request, you'll save us both time!
