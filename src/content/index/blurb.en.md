# Tomas Ravinskas

I'm a freelance coder with over 5 years of experience, system administrator, and occasionally a translator.
My interests primarily center around Linux and Open Source, however I do have experience with Windows API and administration.

After several years as a self-taught programmer, I decided to take the opportunity and acquire formal education in Java with funding provided by the Unemployment Office.

In my spare time I enjoy reading fiction and taking trips on my bike.

Currently I am looking for stable, long-term employment.
